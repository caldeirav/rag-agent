    "# AI Agent with llama stack: Advanced Agent Capabilities with Prompt Chaining and ReAct Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial showcases how to build a local agent leveraging the llama stack, introducing techniques that make a simple retrieval agent smarter and more autonomous: **Prompt Chaining** and the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework**. These approaches allow the agent to complete multi-step tasks, dynamically choose tools, and adjust its behavior based on context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Chaining** connects multiple prompts into a coherent sequence, allowing the agent to maintain context and perform multi-step reasoning across tool invocations. \n",
    "- **ReAct Agent** combines reasoning and acting steps in a loop, enabling the agent to make decisions, use tools dynamically, and adapt based on intermediate results. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore three agent configurations:\n",
    "1. **Simple Retrieval Agent (Baseline)** – Uses a single web search tool.\n",
    "2. **Prompt Chaining** – Performs structured, multi-step reasoning by chaining prompts and responses.\n",
    "3. **ReAct Agent** – Dynamically plans and executes actions using a loop of reasoning and tool use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, ensure that you have:\n",
    "- Access to a [Llama Stack](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) server.\n",
    "- A Tavily API key. It is critical for this notebook to run correctly. You can register for one at [https://tavily.com/](https://tavily.com/)."

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "- This notebook demonstrated how to build more capable agents using Prompt Chaining and the ReAct framework.\n",
    "- It showed how agents can maintain context across multiple steps and perform structured, multi-step reasoning.\n",
    "- It highlights how ReAct enables dynamic tool selection and adaptive decision-making based on intermediate results.\n",
    "- These techniques enhance agent autonomy and make them more suitable for complex operational tasks.\n",
